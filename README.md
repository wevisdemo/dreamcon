# Dream Constitution


## About
Dream Constitution is a project that gathers the opinions of Thai people to serve as a hub of ideas for drafting a people's constitution.  
Because the constitution may sometimes feel distant, we invite everyone to share their diverse dreams and ideas, weaving them into a single story. These ideas will then be passed on to those responsible for drafting the new constitution, so it can truly reflect the will of the people.
